Demonstrating C Pointers. A pointer holds a reference to a memory location.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main()
{
    char word[100] = "Alice and Bob had a communication. It was a good communication. The message arrived as expected.";
    char *ptr;
    ptr=word;
    
    //standard use of for loop to access array index to contrast against the pointers used here.
    printf("Here is your sentence: ");
    for(int i=0; i<strlen(word);i++)
        printf("%c", word[i]);

    //Use of pointer to access array index backwards
    printf("\n\nHere is your sentence backwards: ");
    for(int i=(strlen(word)); i>=0;i--)
        printf("%c", *(ptr+i));
    
    printf("\n\nHere is every other word of your sentence: ");
    for(int i=0; i<strlen(word);i=i+2)
        printf("%c", *(ptr+i));
    
    //*ptr gives us the value at the memory location, ptr gives us the actual address. 0xsomething something.
    //random every time.
    printf("\n\nHere is the memory location of element [0], which the pointer holds: %p", ptr);
    
    return 0;
}
